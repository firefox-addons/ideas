# Ideas

<sub>*Community curated ideas for Webextensions. Please feel free to point us to any possible future directions for us to take on our work.*</sub>

<sub>*Mozilla (stylized as moz://a) is a free-software community created in 1998 by members of Netscape. The Mozilla community uses, develops, spreads and supports Mozilla products, thereby promoting exclusively free software and open standards, with only minor exceptions. The community is supported institutionally by the Mozilla Foundation and its tax-paying subsidiary, the Mozilla Corporation. Mozilla's products include the Firefox web browser, Thunderbird e-mail client, Firefox OS mobile operating system, Bugzilla bug tracking system, Gecko layout engine and others. During 2017, Mozilla acquired Pocket, a "read-it-later-online" service.*</sub>


<sub>*Mozilla Firefox (or simply Firefox) is a free and open-source[18] web browser developed by the Mozilla Foundation and its subsidiary the Mozilla Corporation. Firefox is available for Windows, macOS and Linux operating systems, with its Firefox for Android available for Android (formerly Firefox for mobile, it also ran on the discontinued Firefox OS), and uses the Gecko layout engine to render web pages, which implements current and anticipated web standards.[19] An additional version, Firefox for iOS, was released in late 2015, but this version does not use Gecko due to Apple's restrictions limiting third-party web browsers to the WebKit-based layout engine built into iOS.*</sub>


<sub>*Mozilla add-ons are installable enhancements to the Mozilla Foundation's projects, including Firefox, Thunderbird, SeaMonkey, and Sunbird. Add-ons allow the user to add or augment application features, use themes to their liking, and handle new types of content. There are three major categories of add-ons: "Extensions", "Themes", and "Plugins".[1] The main repository for distributing the first two type is the eponymous Mozilla Add-ons website.*</sub>
